Presentation should answer the following questions:


- WHY should we care about this topic?

Although this topic specifically might of relatively little importance, it reflects the broader purpose of mining useful textual information from a facebook group. This in itself is of great value for social media research and applications. Social media is different to traditional text: It is not i.i.d. due to current affairs affecting content e.g. In our case, course feedback questions are more likely to be due around a particular timeframe

Represents collaborative question answering. 

- What's so CHALLENGING about it?

Short messages consist of few words or phrases, cannot provide sufficient context information for effective similarity measure (too little data for effective text processing methods)

Variance of quality of posts, some are well-written, others are not.

More information (time stamp, links etc.) not necessarily challenging

BOW does not work because semantic gap would cause e.g. "The Dark Night" not to be related to "Batman", except if we use external knowledge

- What are the current VIABLE SOLUTIONS?

2 basic groups of solutions to data sparseness problem:
- Surface representation: exploits phrases in original text from different aspects to preserve contextual information. NLP techniques such as parsing not used
  	  -Disadvantage: no deep understanding of original text
	  -No use of external knowledge (e.g. to fill semantic gap between 'japan earthquake' and 'nuclear crisis')
	  -Solution to this: use external souce to narrow the semantic gap
	  		
Current solution to measure similarlity without use of conventional attribute vecetors is to measure doc similarity based on connectivity (e.g. # possible paths between authors of the docs) and structural similarity (e.g. # of shared neighbours). Unsure however to what extent this can be applied in our case.

- What are we currently UNABLE to do?

- How could the group project findings CONTRIBUTE to this literature?
