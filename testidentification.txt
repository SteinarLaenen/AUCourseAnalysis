Found the middle east today
hola chicos y chicas, 
some ppl have recently contacted the ssc focus group to explore te possibility of developing an "Africa Today" class that is comparable to "The Middle East Today". bearing this in mind, we were wondering HOW MANY of you would be interested in taking such a course? 
as we all know, Africa consists of way more countries than does the Middle East, and, as such, the course "Africa Today" might already indicate a problem of generalizability ... IF u have any thoughts/ideas concerning this, COME TO OUR SSC FOCUS GROUP MEETING at the ab on the 9th of May during lunchbreak <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
but, 4 now, all u have to do is fill in the poll below so we can explore the possibility of (designing) an "Africa Today" course that would meet ur (royalties) demands

Found communication
RIGHT2EDUCATION NEW BOARD:

It's funny how we study Human Rights and talk about refugees and this "crisis", but what are we actually DOING to solve it? How can turn this crisis into an opportunity?
This was what pushed most of the current R2E board members to join what is now an official Stichting (Foundation). This motivation to apply the theories you learn in a class but also to come with your own ideas, your own thoughts and actions. Because that is what theories lack, the action. So, if you want to be part of this active movement, one where we stand up and participate, then consider joining R2E's board either as a treasurer (Dutch speaking), Academic and Teacher coordinator (Dutch speaking), External Communications Manager (Dutch speaking) and TWO Events and Buddy Coordinators (Dutch not required). 
For more info, stalk our website (right2.education) remember our faces and come find us at the AB. To apply, send you CV + motivation letter (300-400 words) specifying your area of interest before the 7TH OF APRIL.

bisous!

Found peace lab environmental law and policy
ghallo frens,

today is an epic day for obvious reasons, but did you know tomorrow is as well???? (gasp)

Lil bird told me TOMORROW is the Social Science Focus Group Day!!!!! This day was designed to raise awareness 4 the goal, function and practice of the FGroups. For this reason, we will foster student-led discussions throughout the day. It goes without saying that you are all cordially invited to attend!

The day is organized as follows:

10:00 Discussion on diversity within the SSC tracks. 
Together with Emma Cohen de Lara, we will (amongst other things) discuss the Political Science track evalutation. Is this track predominantly western-oriented? Do you think other tracks are devoted to theorists who are predominantly white and/or western? Do you think this is a problem? If so, what should change/be included?

12:30 Discussion on the quality of SSC Theme Courses.
Are the Theme Courses too general? Are they challenging? Apt to your academic motivation? Do they contribute to your curriculum? Do they fit within your track?  
In addition to discussing the aforementioned, we will discuss possible changes (for which your input is needed) of tracks. Thijs Etty will join us to talk about possible ways in which the environmental law and policy track could and should be expanded with new theories and methods. Environmental students of the world, unite!

14:00 Discussion on diversity between the tracks. Are there enough tracks? And they cover (enough of) the Social Science field? Maxim Kupovykh is set as to attend this discussion. 

16:00 Discussion on the transition with SSC tracks. Is there a clear, effective and needed transition between 100, 200 and 300 level courses? Does one follow up on the other? Is that prerequisite really needed? Was that 300-level course really more difficult than that 200-level one? Should that 200-level course not count as a 300-level one? 
Here to be present about possible questions on Human Rights and Human Secrity, and Peace Lab, is the one and only Anne de Graaf!

You are ALL invited to attend - whenever you would wish and are able to! If you have thoughts on a specific topic, wish to contribute to the discussion, and are eagerly motivated to represent your track and inform us of possible ways in which it can be improved, join us tomorrow in the AB!

What's the easiest way to fulfill your HUMANITIES requirement?

Any thoughts on the following courses? Or any other suggestions? Any input appreciated :)

• ethics
• big history
• intro to cultural analysis
• early to modern history
• introduction to visual methodologies

200 level courses (doable without prerequisities?)

• Urban Anthropology Lab
• democracy in modern history

Found ethics philosophy
What are the new values of the sharing economy and co-operatives? How can we configure these values so they form the basis for new emerging roles for higher education? 

                                                         ***
This Thursday three guest lecturers will delve into these and related questions. The event is part of a lecture series by the research group 'Commoning UvA' to find an answer to our lead question: 'Who owns the university?' The coming semester will feature monthly lectures aimed at pooling knowledge and stirring dialogues on the topic. 

For this lecture we've invited an artist exploring societal transitions, a UvA-tenured philosopher who co-authored the recent report and referendum on democratisation and decentralisation at the UvA and and an economist specialising in the scale-up of regional food and energy co-operatives. They'll unpack the current developments of ethics and value-creation in the Peer2Peer sharing economy. In the subsequent panel and group discussion we'll together explore the potential we see for translating these trends to the University of Amsterdam. 

                                                         *** 
The event will be held in the city centre campus. The talk is in Dutch (helaas), drinks and snacks are available.
Hope to engage you in interesting thoughts and dialogue on Thursday!

Found communication
Hello dear everyone at AUC,

This incident has made me think quite some.. 
Firstly, Paul Vurst thank you for sharing your story.
Really.
I hope this is positive both for you personally and for the auc community as a whole.

I do really think that it is important to talk about this.
Not sensationally but to question our so-called community.

Now, in my view this ensamble of people living together is an interesting community. Different from models of conscious communal living.
I feel we are somewhere in between community and individualism.
We are a bunch of people who have not consciously decided to live together but we have been put together. We have made friends, lovers, companions, and for a lot of us, auc represents the first steps into adult life.

Coming from a background and interest in this communal living thing, I find the environment around me key for feeling happy. 

Why is this so important for me?
Communication.
I strongly feel that it is by communicating that I can let go of bottled up emotions/ energy/ frustrations (whatever you wanna call it).

And it is in a comfortable surrounding that caters for honest communication between people.

Doing this does not necessarily involve talking about your feelings but perhaps doing something (singing, talking bullshit, running, acting, laughing…) consciously in a comfortable place. Like I said, in order to do this I think comfort is key.

I tend to think: make your problem your solution (nice Permaculture principle here).
How can we turn this around into a positive experience?
How can we, people at auc, support Paul?
Not only him but all people who might need some support every now and then.
(Given that this is what they want).
I mean, we all go through hard times (especially when it gets stressful with school).
How can we make our little community a more comfortable one?

Coming from my own desires, all I really want is a cuddle.
I want to feel loved and comfortable to express myself.
(I used to find it very hard but I am improving).

I feel the need to mention this.. what does everyone else think ? 

Maybe people would like an informal chat about this issue of improving social wellbeing within the auc community (and perhaps in a way that is not overruled or dictated by this institution of ours).

I do have an idea how we could proceed from this incident and how we could improve our social wellbeing but, like I said, I am aware that I come from a different background in this communal living thing and my suggestion might not appeal to everyone.. 

I might be babbling a bit- sure.
Its just hard to try and cyber communicate to so many 100s of people

Do share your thoughts.
I don’t mean to be sensational or preachy, I am just trying to communicate ; )

Love to all,
(spring is nearly here)
Amanda

Found psychology medical anthropology
Heeey guys I'm doing health and well-being track and I'm trying to figure out which track to do with it! For now I'm hesitating between psychology and anthropology...I've heard the psychology track is quite challenging so it might be too much with my health and well-being track but anthropology might not be related at all to what I'm studying already(there is a course called medical anthropology but still). Any thoughts?

Found creative writing
creative writing people, heads up:

"Dear All of You:  
Due to a very sad event, Sarah will not be with us at AUC tomorrow.  She has asked me to look in on her section and to take attendance.  Apparently her section has (the below) assignment, and with that her students/you will be going on auto-pilot for your critique groups.  
For those in her section, rather than have you launch directly into the auto-pilot, please come instead to join my class for the first part of the class period.  I have discussed the situation with AUC and have reserved the big room at the end of our hall (the door will be open!) for all students to come together once again.  It happened on the first day and I think it would be a really positive thing for the groups to reunite for a moment.  As my group is just beginning poetry this week, and Sarah's group is already underway, but also at the beginning of the trajectory, this is a fine moment to merge to collect our thoughts.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
For my class - the assignment still stands (one piece of critique for the dramatic genre, and one poem that has inspired you).  
For Sarah's class - please prepare as she has requested, but if there is time and you would like to actively participate beyond the minimum in my session, then do bring along a poem that has inspired you, to present it to the group.  
Our two groups will stay together for at least one hour to discuss poetry - this will be very, as the Dutch say, gezellig.  
Until tomorrow.  
Claudia"
