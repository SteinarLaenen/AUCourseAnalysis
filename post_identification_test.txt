hola chicos y chicas, 
some ppl have recently contacted the ssc focus group to explore te possibility of developing an "Africa Today" class that is comparable to "The Middle East Today". bearing this in mind, we were wondering HOW MANY of you would be interested in taking such a course? 
as we all know, Africa consists of way more countries than does the Middle East, and, as such, the course "Africa Today" might already indicate a problem of generalizability ... IF u have any thoughts/ideas concerning this, COME TO OUR SSC FOCUS GROUP MEETING at the ab on the 9th of May during lunchbreak <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
but, 4 now, all u have to do is fill in the poll below so we can explore the possibility of (designing) an "Africa Today" course that would meet ur (royalties) demands

ghallo frens,

today is an epic day for obvious reasons, but did you know tomorrow is as well???? (gasp)

Lil bird told me TOMORROW is the Social Science Focus Group Day!!!!! This day was designed to raise awareness 4 the goal, function and practice of the FGroups. For this reason, we will foster student-led discussions throughout the day. It goes without saying that you are all cordially invited to attend!

The day is organized as follows:

10:00 Discussion on diversity within the SSC tracks. 
Together with Emma Cohen de Lara, we will (amongst other things) discuss the Political Science track evalutation. Is this track predominantly western-oriented? Do you think other tracks are devoted to theorists who are predominantly white and/or western? Do you think this is a problem? If so, what should change/be included?

12:30 Discussion on the quality of SSC Theme Courses.
Are the Theme Courses too general? Are they challenging? Apt to your academic motivation? Do they contribute to your curriculum? Do they fit within your track?  
In addition to discussing the aforementioned, we will discuss possible changes (for which your input is needed) of tracks. Thijs Etty will join us to talk about possible ways in which the environmental law and policy track could and should be expanded with new theories and methods. Environmental students of the world, unite!

14:00 Discussion on diversity between the tracks. Are there enough tracks? And they cover (enough of) the Social Science field? Maxim Kupovykh is set as to attend this discussion. 

16:00 Discussion on the transition with SSC tracks. Is there a clear, effective and needed transition between 100, 200 and 300 level courses? Does one follow up on the other? Is that prerequisite really needed? Was that 300-level course really more difficult than that 200-level one? Should that 200-level course not count as a 300-level one? 
Here to be present about possible questions on Human Rights and Human Secrity, and Peace Lab, is the one and only Anne de Graaf!

You are ALL invited to attend - whenever you would wish and are able to! If you have thoughts on a specific topic, wish to contribute to the discussion, and are eagerly motivated to represent your track and inform us of possible ways in which it can be improved, join us tomorrow in the AB!

I am especially looking for some nice juicy stories/experiences ;) but even if they are not I still encourage you to contact me.

Please comment below or message me if you're willing to help me out! Again, I promise an interesting read in return ;)

Identified: modelling real world problems, programming your world, machine learning in
--- looking for advice on the Information Track --

Dear programming folks!
What's your opinion on the following courses concerning quality, workload and usefulness for someone interested in applied science and solving (environmental) problems?

- data structures and algorithms
- machine learning
- text-mining and collective intelligence
- modelling real world problems (is that doable with limited knowledge in statistics?)

So far I've only done "programming your world" (my main track is Environmental Science), and I would like to continue with 1 or 2 courses next semester. I'm pretty sure I will do "Modelling Real World Problems" (unless you convince me otherwise), but not so sure whether a second course makes sense for me, and if yes which one. 

also, if anyone in the information track is up for a chat these days, please let me know, food or drinks in return for your advice :)

For example issues concerning safety, facilities, and capacity of the dorms. Please comment below, or send us an email (ta@aucsc.nl) or a pm, so we can communicate these issues to DUWO.

I'm considering taking this course - can you please give me feedback? How enjoyable and useful is the class?

I took 20th Century History as an A-Level (high school), so I'm already quite familiar with studying it as a subject. Does this Standard Methods course focus a lot on just the methods of analysing history (as the name implies) or do you also get a lot out of the content itself? In other words, I'm interested in taking history classes, but I don't know if this course is particularly useful in studying history itself.

Identified: documentary in
It is Week of Poverty in the Netherlands:
This initiative brings an issue into the spotlight, which should be talked about much more.

Check out this website with many interesting and thought provoking documentaries about the problematic of
world poverty.

'Give us the money' discusses the efficiency of Bono and Bob Geldof's campaigns to fight famine in Africa and enters into a debate about government aid for Africa.

Its a question of attitude:
Should we be merely Drivers, or rather good Partners?
